# Region Selection Toolkit :wave:

## Project Description

**Region Selection Toolkit** is a comprehensive solution for guiding cloud architects and IT teams in selecting the optimal Microsoft Azure region for their workloads. This toolkit automates the complex analysis required when deciding “Which Azure region should we deploy to?”. It evaluates multiple factors – from service availability and compliance to sustainability and performance – to recommend the best region(s) for a given set of cloud resources. The goal is to streamline regional planning for scenarios such as migrating to a new Azure region, expanding an application into additional regions, or choosing a region for a new deployment.
